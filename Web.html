<h1>who is duhul</h1>
<h3>My name is Duhul Nethsara Tharushmith, 
but most people call me Tharu.
 I was born on August 30, 2007, and I'm a student from Sri Lanka. I'm curious and like learning about technology, mobile devices, and how things work. I usually prefer short and direct answers. I also enjoy high-beat rap music, especially when my name is included in the lyrics. I'm energetic, practical, and always interested in exploring new ideas</h3>
